      <p> I moved to Portland about a month ago from Oakland, CA. Before that, I'd been living in Austin, TX. Before that, I lived in Seattle. I feel like a Pacific Northwesterner in my heart of hearts. I love it here in Portland! </p>

    <h3> Education and Employment Background </h3>
      <p>I attended the University of Washington in Seattle where I earned a BS in Philosophy. My plans for my life changed about a year before I graduated and I had a classic early-20's thought of "I don't actually have any clue what I want to do for a realistic career." I finished my degree anyway, and then started working in coffee shops. I have been working in coffee shops ever since I graduated in 2008! My most recent job was my best job. I worked at a place called <span class="Timeless"> Timeless Coffee </span> for 5 years. It's the longest amount of time I've ever had a single job. The company itself has lots of opportunities for growth and challenge within the world of coffee. Eventually I ended up becoming the main manager for <span class="Timeless"> Timeless</span> and was able to assist in opening new locations for us. I managed a staff of about 30 employees, did scheduling, payroll, hiring, training, reviews and write-ups. This job is where I gained my strongest communication skills  -- not only in face-to-face interactions with customers, but also with the dozens of emails I'd send out weekly to my bosses, potential employees, customer complaints, etc. </p>
      <p>When I moved to Portland, I became an independent contractor for <span class="Timeless">Timeless.</span> I work 10 hours a week with them, mainly advising the new management and writing the Operations Manual for the store in order to more easily facilitate the opening of new locations. I enjoy working with my bosses at Timeless. They have been solid role models for me ever since I've known them. They are ambitious and caring people. Plus, I just love the company itself. And all the coffee!</p>
      <p>I decided to study coding because I want to be able to find a reliable, well-paying career that doesn't necessarily involve being on my feet for most of the day. Having never worked in an office before, I am really attracted to an office environment. I was particularly interested in attending a bootcamp because I'm attracted to the intensity and speed of it. I am also attracted to structure. I love having a set of rules to follow or tasks to complete. I love the straight forward aspect of it and my brain thrives most in a structured, regimented environment.</p>
    <h3> My time at Epicodus so Far</h3>

        <div class="coding">
          <p> Having no previous computer experience, it has been an extremely intense and challenging week. But I have already learned a <strong>lot more</strong> than I ever knew about computers before. Epicodus has provided the most positive, encouraging, and welcoming environment I've ever encountered. I struggle with learning some of the most basic coding concepts, but having a class full of new friends and teachers who want to help has made it much easier to keep coming back. </p>

        <p>Here are some links to some of my best work so far, in no particular order: </p>
      </div>
        <ul>
          <div class="column">
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Bob-s-Blog.git"> Bob Loblaws Law Blog </a></li>
            <em><p> This project is based on a character from one of my all-time favorite shows, Arrested Development. In it, we included photos and blurbs (lorem ipsum) of Bob's clients, competition, and a short "About Me" section at the very bottom. Written from the perspective of Bob Loblaw. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet created by me and my partner for that day. This was my first time using the "div" HTML element. It also includes some basic images.</p></em>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/sweet-cuppin-cakes.git"> Sweet Cuppin Cakes</a></li>
            <em><p> This project is for a bakery called Sweet Cuppin' Cakes. The title made us laugh every time it came up, so it ended up being a great name for our mock bakery. On this site is listed what the bakery is, what is does, and items offered. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet, created by me and my partner for that day. It also includes images</p></em>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Beach-Balls-Resort.git"> Beach Balls Resort</a></li>
            <em><p> This project is for a resort called Beach Balls Resort. My partner and I made the whole thing funny and ridiculous...this was before I really grasped the idea that we'd be coming back to this project at some point. I really like the setup since it's my only project with multiple pages and navigation to HOME on each page. The content is teenager-style-humor. I'm 33 and <strong>still</strong> chuckle every time I hear the word "balls." This project contains 6 different HTML documents: one is the homepage, and the 5 others can each navigate back to the homepage. It also uses a custom CSS stylesheet.</em>
          </div>
        </ul>
    <h3> Some Personal Information </h3>
        <p> In my free time, I really like to exercise. I love <span class="activities"> hiking, yoga, and running (honestly: jogging).</span> I also just recently started cycling again after taking almost 2 years off my bike. Living in Portland has opened the door for me to feel comfortable commuting by bike again. The condition of the streets is generally better than it was in Oakland. And the drivers strike me as <strong>far</strong> more considerate to cyclists than most drivers I'd encountered in the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>  I like to cook - anthing from basic foods that don't really need a recipe all the way to intricate recipes that could take multiple hours to complete. My amount of free time determines what I'm able to make. I've been eating a lot of fried eggs and peanut butter sandwiches since starting at Epicodus (both delicious). My favorite TV show is The Great British Baking show...I cannot get enough of this show! I watched a bunch of episodes before class started because I decided to cancel my Netflix account while attending school. It will help me stay focused! Maybe when I re-subscribe to Netflix (once I graduate), there will be a whole new season for me to watch. <em>Oh boy!</em></p>
        <p> I am generally a very energetic, upbeat, and positive person. I have strong people skills and communication skills. I highly value straight-forward, well-intentioned communication. I believe any interpersonal issue can be solved using this type of communication and I kind of see it like a tool that I keep in order to navigate my relationships. </p>
        <p> My all-time <strong>favorite</strong> food in the whole world is veggie pho. I could eat it for every meal, and then bathe in it ever night and still not get sick of it. </p>
