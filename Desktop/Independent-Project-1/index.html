    <h2> Here are a few tidbits about me that might be fun for you to know </h2>
    <h3> I just started attending a computer coding Bootcamp called Epicodus</h3> 
    <p> Having no previous computer experience, it has been an extremely intense and challenging week. But I have already learned a LOT MORE than I ever knew about computers before. I get stuck on implementing basic commands, but am absorbing the content of the class slowly but surely. Keeping my confidence up has been the most challenging part of the entire program for me so far! This has been an issue of mine for many years, so I'm looking forward for an opportunity to be able to show myself that I AM a capable person and my brain isn't just mush.</p>
