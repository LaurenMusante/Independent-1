    <h1> So you want to know LAUREN? </h1>
    <img src="images/oakland.jpg" alt="Where I am from" class="pic">
      <p> I moved to Portland about a month ago from Oakland, CA. Before that, I'd been living in Austin, TX. Before that, I lived in Seattle. I feel like a Pacific Northwesterner in my heart of hearts. I love it here in Portland! </p>
    <h2> Here are a few tidbits about me that might be fun for you to know </h2>
    <h3> I just started attending a computer coding Bootcamp called Epicodus</h3>
    <img src="images/symbol.png" alt="Epicodus logo" class="pic"
      <p> Having no previous computer experience, it has been an extremely intense and challenging week. But I have already learned a LOT MORE than I ever knew about computers before. Epicodus has provided the most positive, encouraging, and welcoming environment I've ever encountered. I struggle with learning some of the most basic coding concepts, but having a class full of new friends and teachers who want to help has made it much easier to keep coming back. </p>
      <p>Here are links to some of my best work so far. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Bob-s-Blog.git"> Bob Loblaws Law Blog </a></li>
            <p> This project is based on a character from one of my all-time favorite shows, Arrested Development. In it, we included photos and blurbs (lorem ipsum) of Bob's clients, competition, and a short "About Me" section at the very bottom. Written from the perspective of Bob Loblaw. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet created by me and my partner for that day. This was my first time using the
            "div" HTML element. It also includes some basic images.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/sweet-cuppin-cakes.git"> Sweet Cuppin Cakes</a></li>
            <p> This project is for a bakery called Sweet Cuppin' Cakes. The title made us laugh every time it came up, so it ended up being a great name for our mock bakery. On this site is listed what the bakery is, what is does, and items offered. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet, created by me and my partner for that day. It also includes images</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Beach-Balls-Resort.git"> Beach Balls Resort</a></li>
            <p> This project is for a resort called Beach Balls resort. My partner and I made the whole thing funny and ridiculous...this was before I really grasped the idea that we'd be coming back to this project at some point. I really like the setup since it's my only project with multiple pages and navigation to HOME on each page. The content is teenager-style-humor. I'm 33 and still chuckle every time I hear the word "balls." This project contains 6 different HTML documents: one is the homepage, and the 5 others can each navigate back to the homepage. It also uses a custom CSS stylesheet.
        </ul>
