    <h1> So you want to know LAUREN? </h1>
    <img src="images/oakland.jpg" alt="Where I am from" class="pic">
      <p> I moved to Portland about a month ago from Oakland, CA. Before that, I'd been living in Austin, TX. Before that, I lived in Seattle. I feel like a Pacific Northwesterner in my heart of hearts. I love it here in Portland! </p>
    <h2> Here are a few tidbits about me that might be fun for you to know </h2>
    <h3> Background </h3>
      <p>I attended the University of Washington in Seattle where I earned a BS in Philosophy. My plans for my life changed about a year before I graduated and I had a classic early-20's thought of "I don't actually have any clue what I want to do for a realistic career." I finished my degree anyway, and then started working in coffee shops. I have been working in coffee shops ever since I graduated in 2008! My most recent job was my best job. I worked at a place called Timeless Coffee for 5 years. It's the longest job I've ever had. The company itself has lots of opportunities for growth and challenge within the world of coffee. Eventually I ended up becoming the main manager for Timeless and was able to assist in opening new locations for us. I managed a staff of about 30 employees, did scheduling, payroll, hiring, training, reviews and write-ups. This job is where I gained my strongest communication skills  -- not only in face-to-face interactions with customers, but also with the dozens of emails I'd send out weekly to my bosses, potential employees, customer complaints, etc. </p>
      <p>When I moved to Portland, I became an independent contractor for Timeless. I work 10 hours a week with them, mainly writing the Operations Manual for the store in order to more easily facilitate the opening of new locations. I enjoy working with my bosses at Timeless. They have been solid role models for me ever since I've known them. They are ambitious and caring people. Plus, I just love the company itself. And all the coffee!</p>
      <p>I decided to study coding because I want to be able to find a reliable, well-paying career that doesn't necessarily involve being on my feet for most of the day. Having never worked in an office before, I am really attracted to an office environment. I was particularly interested in attending a bootcamp because I'm attracted to the intensity and speed of it. I am also attracted to structure. I love having a set of rules to follow or tasks to complete. I love the straight forward aspect of it and my brain thrives most in a structured, regimented environment.</p>
    <h3> I just started attending a computer coding Bootcamp called Epicodus</h3>
    <img src="images/symbol.png" alt="Epicodus logo" class="pic"
      <p> Having no previous computer experience, it has been an extremely intense and challenging week. But I have already learned a LOT MORE than I ever knew about computers before. Epicodus has provided the most positive, encouraging, and welcoming environment I've ever encountered. I struggle with learning some of the most basic coding concepts, but having a class full of new friends and teachers who want to help has made it much easier to keep coming back. </p>
      <p>Here are links to some of my best work so far. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Bob-s-Blog.git"> Bob Loblaws Law Blog </a></li>
            <p> This project is based on a character from one of my all-time favorite shows, Arrested Development. In it, we included photos and blurbs (lorem ipsum) of Bob's clients, competition, and a short "About Me" section at the very bottom. Written from the perspective of Bob Loblaw. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet created by me and my partner for that day. This was my first time using the
            "div" HTML element. It also includes some basic images.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/sweet-cuppin-cakes.git"> Sweet Cuppin Cakes</a></li>
            <p> This project is for a bakery called Sweet Cuppin' Cakes. The title made us laugh every time it came up, so it ended up being a great name for our mock bakery. On this site is listed what the bakery is, what is does, and items offered. It was written in HTML and styled with a custom CSS stylesheet, created by me and my partner for that day. It also includes images</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaurenMusante/Beach-Balls-Resort.git"> Beach Balls Resort</a></li>
            <p> This project is for a resort called Beach Balls resort. My partner and I made the whole thing funny and ridiculous...this was before I really grasped the idea that we'd be coming back to this project at some point. I really like the setup since it's my only project with multiple pages and navigation to HOME on each page. The content is teenager-style-humor. I'm 33 and still chuckle every time I hear the word "balls." This project contains 6 different HTML documents: one is the homepage, and the 5 others can each navigate back to the homepage. It also uses a custom CSS stylesheet.
        </ul>
