      <p> I moved to Portland about a month ago from Oakland, CA. Before that, I'd been living in Austin, TX. Before that, I lived in Seattle. I feel like a Pacific Northwesterner in my heart of hearts. I love it here in Portland! </p>
    <h2> Here are a few tidbits about me that might be fun for you to know </h2>
    <h3> I just started attending a computer coding Bootcamp called Epicodus</h3>
    <img src="images/symbol.png" alt="Epicodus logo" class="pic"
      <p> Having no previous computer experience, it has been an extremely intense and challenging week. But I have already learned a LOT MORE than I ever knew about computers before. Epicodus has provided the most positive, encouraging, and welcoming environment I've ever encountered. I struggle with learning some of the most basic coding concepts, but having a class full of new friends and teachers who want to help has made it much easier to keep coming back. </p>
      <p>Here are links to some of my best work so far. </p>
